<a href="https://momentjs.com">Moment.js</a> is a JavaScript library that can parse, manipulate, and format dates and times. To format a date, you give Moment a time code like <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>. When I was working front-end at [Nudge.ai](https://www.nudge.ai)</a>, I found myself having to go to Moment's documentation to see how to format dates in various ways.

In order to make the process of date formatting faster, I created [WTFormat.com](https://wtformat.com), which gives you a date which you rewite in your preferred format. The site then generates the Moment format code that would yield that output.
