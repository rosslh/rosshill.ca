## Header

This year, I'm on the QHack's technology team, building internal tools and improving our online presence. QHacks is a hackathon hosted at Queen’s University where software developers come together to collaborate on projects and win prizes. I am helping to create a landing page for the event and the “QHacks Dashboard”, an online platform for QHacks participants. Through building these and other tools, I aim help the QHacks team run a smooth and successful event!
